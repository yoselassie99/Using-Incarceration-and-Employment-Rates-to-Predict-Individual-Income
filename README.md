# Using Incarceration and Employment Rates to Predict Individual Income

## Background
It is often believed that children are simply a product of their environment, as their surroundings shape the adult they later become.







## Business Question
How does neighborhood incarceration and employment rate predict household income?

# Data Source
https://github.com/yoselassie99/Using-Incarceration-and-Employment-Rates-to-Predict-Individual-Income/blob/main/Opportunity%20Atlas%20Data%202.xlsx
All data was obtained from the Opportunity Atlas Database. Data was stratified by parent's income group (high, middle, low) to determine the role incarceration and employment rates have in predicting household income.


#Data Analysis
To begin the analysis, I thought it would be interesting to compare income, incarceration rates and employment rates between income groups just to get a general idea on the environment these samples are growing up in.
